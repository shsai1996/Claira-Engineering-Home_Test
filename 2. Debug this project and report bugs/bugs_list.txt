Product design issues 
  what should be done if same file repeated for upload 
  what should be done if empty data is uploaded 

1) When new csv file uploaded data is getting appended instead of overwriting , option should be given to user to override or append
2) If same file is uploaded, instead of checking exisiting entries (or equivalent) data getting appended to previous data 
3) When empty file uploaded show an error with empty data has been recived instead showing details with all 0s
4) Positive amount like salary also being calculated as expense and added to total_expense (abs is used, need to remove postive values from transactions)
5) No category defined for Salary or other incomes
6) In Copilot generaly query giving wrong total where summing of all happening without abs, so total expense is not correct here. 
7) Monthly expense query has to be adjusted as per transaction data , not per current date for better visbility
8) Other category not summrised as it does not have id, add others id if no category found 
9) What was my biggest purchase in December? returns empty, ideally time filter should check month and year wise not latest one only
10) What is my biggest expense gives salary credit (+ve value) instead of expense
11) what is my lowest expense returns totla number of transactions
12) prompt improvement can be done 

versioning of APIs is good idea if features have to be isolated like api/v1 , api/v2 like this.
Adding swagger documentation is good idea if FE team has to check the APIs before integrating
Better to show list of csv files also uploaded in the past to avoid repetetion 


Frontend 
1) Enable Dashboard/Transactions/Copilot only when data is availble, atleast one transaction (use an API if data exists with valid transactions)
2) If empty file uploaded show an error in FE only and ask user if still wanted to upload. 
3) You spent $-136.47 on Entertainment coming in copilot, - symbol should not show as it is already spent 
4) Disable total expense if no transactions are available in backend (grayed out the total)
5) Sorting by date, category, amount is good idea 
6) Overall average transaction amount good to show
7) Other category not shown as backend not sending them in summarised data


Better to show list of csv files uploaded history in the past to avoid duplicates
